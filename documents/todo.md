# Frontend

### Cosmetic design
1. Icons for the tabs. 

### Practical features
1. Add tooltips and status tips for all buttons and input boxes. 





# Backend

### Brillouin Zone Calculator
1. lab coordinate to crystal coordinate, and backward. The problem now is how we can define the
   relative orientation of teh crystal with respect to the lab coordinate. (Now we are looking to
   generalize it to non-cubic systems.)
2. 
3. Add another canvas to plot out the Brillouin zone with a point indicating the HKL.

### tragetroy planner
1. a list of theta and phi, calculate the HKs. 
# General
1. Extend it beyond cubic systems. 


# Test 
1. Test the Brillouin zone calculator with a known structure.
